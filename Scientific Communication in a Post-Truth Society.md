# Scientific Communication in a Post-Truth Society
Created: 2021-11-28 11:34


* Initial efforts to communicate scientific ideas emphasised how the information was conveyed - the format, the language used and the content
* However, more recently it's become apparent that the bigger issue is the presence of misinformation and disinformation. 
* as of 2016, only 21% of the American population believed that scientists would act in  the best interests of the public. (Ref 2)
* The progression to this points is outlined as:
	* 1970s: only a small number of broadcasters and nationally syndicated newspapers (NYT, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times). couple of weekly news digests: Time, Newsweek, US News, and World Report. 
	* At the same time the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) enforced a "fairness doctrine" that required all broadcasters to present information in a balanced and honest manner. 
	* 1987: FCC removes the fairness doctrine concomitant with the rise of talk radio. leads to ideologically based reporting and was no longer just factual/ honest. After this there's a large increase in the number of broadcasting platforms. 
	* 1996: Telecommunications Act allows private companies to buy/ own multiple TV and Radio stations. large companies by up smaller independent broadcasters. Effectively things begin to homogenise...

* From the mid 90's to 2010: Creation of internet, explosion of social media platforms with a vast number of uses (2.2 billion). the ideologically based media outlets expand into this space and often misrepresent facts.
