# Scientific Communication in a Post-Truth Society
Created: 2021-11-28 11:34


* Initial efforts to communicate scientific ideas emphasised how the information was conveyed - the format, the language used and the content
* However, more recently it's become apparent that the bigger issue is the presence of misinformation and disinformation. 
* as of 2016, only 21% of the American population believed that scientists would act in  the best interests of the public. (Ref 2)
* The progression to this points is outlined as:
	* 1970s: only a small number of broadcasters and nationally syndicated newspapers (NYT, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times). couple of weekly news digests: Time, Newsweek, US News, and World Report. 
	* At the same time the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) enforced a "fairness doctrine" that required all broadcasters to present information in a balanced and honest manner. 
	* 1987: FCC removes the fairness doctrine concomitant with the rise of talk radio. leads to ideologically based reporting and was no longer just factual/ honest. After this there's a large increase in the number of broadcasting platforms. 
	* 1996: Telecommunications Act allows private companies to buy/ own multiple TV and Radio stations. large companies by up smaller independent broadcasters. Effectively things begin to homogenise...

* From the mid 90's to 2010: Creation of internet, explosion of social media platforms with a vast number of uses (2.2 billion). the ideologically based media outlets expand into this space and often misrepresent facts. 
* misinformation is propagated by online trolls, most of which are bots.
* The situation is further compounded by algorithms decided to pull users in for extend amounts of time using clickbait based on previously viewed content. these are used to drive advertising revenue up. This spirals as the content suggestions becomes narrower and narrower leading users to extreme views. 
	* YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century (Refs 3 & 4)

* The article defines fake news, misinformation and disinformation. i personally find the distinctions to be arbitrary and unconvincing:
	* fake news: fabricated information designed to mimic mainstream media content but which in reality is designed to spread lies rather than truth;
	*  misinformation — false or misleading information put into circulation to cause alarm and confusion
	*  disinformation — false information that is circulated with the intention to deceive 

* i personally think fake news and disinformation are the same thing based on their definition. Misinformation seems to be an offshoot of a similar idea. they've arbitrarily defined it as intended to cause alarm above and beyond the intention to deceive/ spread lies. Not sure why there's a need for this definition. the intent to cause alarm/ sow distrusts is in my mind probably implicit with the general aim to spread lies. 

* The article is beginning to show it's biases despite claiming to be above partisan politics. the article claims that the reduction in trust in science is primarily the fault of right wing politics. this is also mirrored in a statistic they quoted earlier about Politifact rating 59% of Fox New's assertions as mostly or all false (compared to 'only' 27% for left leaning CNN). 
	* in order to properly ascertain the truth of these assertions i'd have to go look at the research being quoted and understand how statements are being categorised as true/ false. unfortunately, due to the very issues this article is discussing, it's possible that researchers are labeling certain views as false based on their own political biases, thus creating the skew seen...


* The article does correctly identify the point that political polarisation has caused each side to deny the credibility of the other and to view them as existential threats. 
	* Increased Partisan Animosity: 1980s: American National Election Surveys (ANES) shows that each side increasingly views the other as possessing negative qualities. However, levels of partisans expressing intense negativity for the opposing side only began to increase post-2000s (increasing for 8% (2000) up to 21% (2016)).
