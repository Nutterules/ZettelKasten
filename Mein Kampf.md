My religious life is dead. it's hollow, unavailing and barren. 


Yechezkiel 37,3
וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֔י בֶּן־אָדָ֕ם הֲתִֽחְיֶ֣ינָה הָֽעֲצָמ֣וֹת הָאֵ֑לֶּה וָֽאֹמַ֕ר אֲדֹנָ֥י יֱהֹוִ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה יָדָֽעְתָּ:


Yechezkiel 37,11
וַיֹּאמֶר֘ אֵלַי֒ בֶּן־אָדָ֕ם הָֽעֲצָמ֣וֹת הָאֵ֔לֶּה כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל הֵ֑מָּה הִנֵּ֣ה אֹֽמְרִ֗ים יָֽבְשׁ֧וּ עַצְמוֹתֵ֛ינוּ וְאָבְדָ֥ה תִקְוָתֵ֖נוּ נִגְזַ֥רְנוּ לָֽנוּ


I have no relationship at all with Hashem. that was pretty much destroyed by rav blachmans hashgacha pratis shuir.

I hate learning, can't be bothered anymore to put the effort in to then get nothing of any value out of it 

RB said my obligation is to learn irrespective of how i might feel. but this isn't sustainable. without my torah life being sufused with meaning, genuine meaning, then it's destined to fail. it won't last long against the backdrop of the west 

i want nothing more than to just forget hashem. throw off his yoke and be done with it all.
Reminded of the medrash of Hashem showing Adam the rest of the world from the entrance to the garden of Eden. Adam sees a world of thorns. I too see a world of thorns. i know that going out into it won't bring me any meaning whatsoever. However, the problem is the garden itself is a desolate, forlorn and godforsaken hellhole. 


Yechezkiel 37,4
וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֔י הִנָּבֵ֖א עַל־הָֽעֲצָמ֣וֹת הָאֵ֑לֶּה וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֲלֵיהֶ֔ם הָֽעֲצָמוֹת֙ הַיְבֵשׁ֔וֹת שִׁמְע֖וּ דְּבַר־יְהֹוָֽה

- but where is the 'Davar Hashem'?  how do i find it and connect to it? 


I am pulled on the one hand by things i think could genuinely enhance my understanding of the world in a deep and profound way (maths, science and philosophy) but pulled on the other hand by obligation and duty to Torah learning which brings me nothing
