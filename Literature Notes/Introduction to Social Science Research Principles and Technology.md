(The following is a summary of the major points in Chapter 1)

- A <u>POPULATION</u> is the group of members that you're interested in studying
- A <u>PARAMETER</u> is value derived from or applied to a population 
- A <u>SAMPLE</u> is a chosen subsection of a population.
- A <u>STATISTIC</u> is a value generated from the sample. 

**Considerations to keep in mind**
1) A population doesn't need to be large to be considered a population - eg it can contain only a few members 
2) A population can be anything, it doesn't just have to be humans 
3) The research typically defines the population either explicitly or implicitly 
4) The sample taken can very easily not be representative of the population as a whole that it's been drawn from. 

**Inferential and Descriptive Statistics**
- Descriptive statistics can only describe the sample or population that they've been calculated from
- Inferential statistics though is an attempt to take the statistics generated from a sample and to apply/ generalise these to the population as a whole. 

**Sampling Methods**
- <u>Random Sampling</u>
	- this doesn't mean samples are taken in a haphazard manner. 
	- it means that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. 
	- the benefit of random sampling is that any differences between the sample and the population are hopefully just due to chance rather than a systematic issue. 

- <u>Representative Sampling</u>
	- This is were the proportions of the various subgroups in a population are accurately represented in the sample that's taken. 
	- for example: proportionate numbers of men and women appear in the sample.

- <u>Convenience Sampling</u>
	- This is where participants are picked based on ease of access, proximity, and willingness to cooperate. 
	- This method of sampling is of course less labour intensive that the other 2; however, as long as the convenience sample doesn't differ from the population in anyway that might affect the outcome of the study then it doesn't matter. 

**Types of Variables **
- A <u>Variable</u> is anything that can be coded and can take more than a single value (income, gender, height)
- A <u>constant</u> on the other hand can only take  a single value. e.g.  if every member of a category was male then the gender category is constant. 

- <u>Quantitative / Continuous</u> variables indicate an amount 
- <u>Qualitative/ Categorical</u> variables just indicate a difference but not more or less of a certain quality. 

**Scales of Measurement**
There are 4:
- <u>Nominal</u>: these just indicate separate categories 
- <u>Ordinal</u>: Provide a meaningful order for the values but the difference between those groups isn't indicated and might not be uniform. 
- <u>Interval</u>: This is the same as ordinal but the difference between the groups is uniform
- <u>Ratio</u>: similar to interval but the values can take a 0 value too. 

**Research Designs**
- <u>Experimental Design</u>: Where a sample is divided into groups to determine the effect of one or more variables of interest. These include Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) where the separation into the various groups is done randomly.
