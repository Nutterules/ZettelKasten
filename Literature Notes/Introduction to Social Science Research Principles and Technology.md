- A **POPULATION** is the group of members that you're interested in studying
	- a **PARAMETER** is value derived from or applied to a population 
- A **SAMPLE** is a chosen subsection of a population.
	- A **STATISTIC** is a value generated from the sample. 


1) A population doesn't need to be large to be considered a population - eg it can contain only a few members 
2) A population can be anything, it doesn't just have to be humans 
3) The research typically defines the population either explicitly or implicitly 
4) The sample taken can very easily not be representative of the population as a whole that it's been drawn from.
