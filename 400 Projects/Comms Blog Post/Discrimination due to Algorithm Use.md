```ad-note
title: Question to consider

- How do we ensure that the algorithms that we develop and use are actually fair? 
- How do we deal with uncomfortable outcomes from these algorithms? What do we do if they clash with societal ideals around diversity of workforce
- Could these algorithms be 'gamed'? if one has a knowledge of the key terms it's looking for then they can much more easily get their resume selected irrespective of actual expeirence. A human would much more easily notice trite and cliched terms whereas an algorithm search for terms of course wouldn't.
