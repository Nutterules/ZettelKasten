i think the best course of action is to do the machine learning stuff in a jupyter notebook 

i think my first zettel's should be torah ones 

start of by learning major sugyas i think? 
- rov
- chazaka 
- etc

Could also possible do daf yomi stuff?
- might be easier to get into than sugyas atm




NEW PLAN: (FOR NOW... :) ):

Learn (seriously) for Rabbi Zobin's shuir
- need to catch up on topher (though might write off it's towards the end of the sugya)

before work: learn shabbos bekius
- do this properly whilst engaged with it and not just listening to a shuir/ reading a trasnaltion. actually think about it.
- object is to get fast
