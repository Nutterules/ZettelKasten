i think the best course of action is to do the machine learning stuff in a jupyter notebook 

i think my first zettel's should be torah ones 

start of by learning major sugyas i think? 
- rov
- chazaka 
- etc

Could also possible do daf yomi stuff?
- might be easier to get into than sugyas atm

---------------------


# NEW PLAN: (FOR NOW... :) ):

## Learn (seriously) for Rabbi Zobin's shuir
- need to catch up on topher (though might write off it's towards the end of the sugya)

## before work: learn shabbos bekius
- do this properly whilst engaged with it and not just listening to a shuir/ reading a trasnaltion. actually think about it.
- object is to get faster in reading 

- maybe do tosfos as well but with help of dafyomi.co.il

----------------------------------------------------

## order of study:
- before starting, read quickly through the background info section 
- then learn
- summarise points outside
- look at dafyomi.co.il summary 
- zichru simanim
- take obsidian literature notes for what i believe to be the major points (def not all)
	- create a seperate note for each point (i think giving the context)
- try to start permanent notes about how this content relates to other stuff
