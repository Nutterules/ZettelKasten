Mishna rules that if a young girl is raped in a city with a **Rov** kohanim then she's allowed to marry a kohen 

interesting application of **Rov**
how does this align with Rov and chazaka elsewhere? 
are the people considered fixed? bit like the meat shop stuff (think this comes up in kesubos too somewhere)
