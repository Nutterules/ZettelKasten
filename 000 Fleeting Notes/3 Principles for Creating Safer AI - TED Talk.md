- problem with creating super intelligent AI - could lead to our extinction 
- we need to be sure that what we tell the machines to do is actually what we want (norbert wiener, 1960)
	- single minded persuit by the machine of a goal 
	- king midas: everything i touch turn to gold ==> family and food all gold and he dies miserable and alone


therefore we should seek to create AI that: 
	- it's only objective is maximising the realisation of human goals 
		- ie it's not self interested so it won't stop itself being turned off
	- it doesn't know those goals initially 
		- removes the single minded pursuit
	- is informed by human behaviour by what we want 
		- my problem with this though is that often we don't act in accordance with what we value so it will learn the wrong things
