Population - the set of items that are of interest 

<ins>Census</ins> - collect data on an entire population 
- advantages:
	- Get an entriely accurate picture of the population
- cons:
	- more expensive
	- time consuming 
	- can't be done if item is distroyed in the process
	- more difficult to process as large amount of data  
 
<u>sample</u> - collect data from only part of the population
- pros:
	- Quicker
	- less expensive
	- doesn't require a resposne from all people
	- less data than a census
- cons:
	- not as accurate
	- sample might not account properly from sub populations due to size of sample not being large enough

### Sample types:
- Random:
	- <u>simple random</u>: every sample that's taken has an equal chance of being sample
		- pros: 
			- no bias
			- cheap and easy to implement for small populations
			- each sample has a known and equal chance of selection
		- cons:
			- not suitable for large populations 
			- a sampling frame is needed (a list of people/ things which are assinged unique ID's)

	- <u>systematic random<u>: samples are taken at regular intervals from an ordered list. the first sample is chosen at random from which the regular interval then begins
		- pros: 
			- simple/ quick
			- can be used for large populations 
		- cons:
			- sampling frame is needed. this can introduce bias if this isn't randomised.

	- <u>stratified random: the sample is divided into it's mutually exclusive strata and random samples are then taken from each.
		- pros: 
			- accurately represents the population structure 
			- guarentees proportional representation of the substrata within the population
		- cons:
			- must have prior knowledge of substrata and be able to accurately define those groups 
			- sampling within these substrata has the same cons as simple random sampling
