- pros:
	- Quicker
	- less expensive
	- doesn't require a resposne from all people
	- less data than a census

- Sample types:
	- Random:
		- simple random: every sample that's taken has an equal chance of being sample
			- pros: 
				- no bias
				- cheap and easy to implement for small populations
				- each sample has a h
			- cons:
				- 
		- systematic random: samples are taken at regular intervals from an ordered list. the first sample is chosen at random from which the regular interval then begins
		- stratified random: the sample is divided into it's mutually exclusive strata and random samples are then taken from each.
