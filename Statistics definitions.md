Population - the set of items that are of interest 

<ins>Census</ins> - collect data on an entire population 
- advantages:
	- Get an entriely accurate picture of the population
- cons:
	- more expensive
	- time consuming 
	- can't be done if item is distroyed in the process
	- more difficult to process as large amount of data  
 
<u>sample</u> - collect data from only part of the population
- pros:
	- Quicker
	- less expensive
	- doesn't require a resposne from all people
	- less data than a census
- cons:
	- not as accurate
	- sample might not account properly from sub populations due to size of sample not being large enough

### Sample types:
- <u><b>Random</b></u>:
	- <u>simple random</u>: every sample that's taken has an equal chance of being sample
		- pros: 
			- no bias
			- cheap and easy to implement for small populations
			- each sample has a known and equal chance of selection
		- cons:
			- not suitable for large populations 
			- a sampling frame is needed (a list of people/ things which are assinged unique ID's)

	- <u>systematic random</u>: samples are taken at regular intervals from an ordered list. the first sample is chosen at random from which the regular interval then begins
		- pros: 
			- simple/ quick
			- can be used for large populations 
		- cons:
			- sampling frame is needed. this can introduce bias if this isn't randomised.

	- <u>stratified random</u>: the sample is divided into it's mutually exclusive strata and random samples are then taken from each.
		- pros: 
			- accurately represents the population structure 
			- guarentees proportional representation of the substrata within the population
		- cons:
			- must have prior knowledge of substrata and be able to accurately define those groups 
			- sampling within these substrata has the same cons as simple random sampling 
- <u><b>Non-Random</b></u>:
	- <u>Quota sampling</u>: a researcher will select a sample that is representative of the entire population
		- pros:
			- small sample can be representative
			- no sampling frame 
			- quick, easy and inexpensive
		- cons:
			- can have sampling bias as not random
			- need to divide population into groups which can be costly/ inaccurate 
			- difficult to scale the population being studied as this increases the number of groups
	- <u>opportunity sampling</u>: sample people available at the time and location of when and where the sample was taken
		- pros:
			- easy and inexpensive
		- cons:
			- not representative of populations
			- will be affected by each individual researcher 


### Types of data
- quantitative data: numerical data
- qualitative data: non_numerical 

- continuous variables: can take any value within a given range 
- discrete data: only specific values within a given range
